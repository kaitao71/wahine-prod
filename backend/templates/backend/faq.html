You can consider W Vault as an online security vault or a digital safebox where you can safely keep your important information and documents.  It is an easy way to manage, organize and secure your important information in an increasingly digital world. We understand that this is sensitive and private information.  For this reason, we have added security measures so the information is safe from corruption, theft and hacking.

              <br><br> W Vault provides an easy-to-use platform where you can organize information and documents on your assets and liabilities.  Several categories have been pre-prepared which prompts the essential information required to enable your loved ones/ next of kin to locate, access or administer your assets and liabilities.  The “Others” category allows you to add other assets and liabilities that have not been pre-prepared by W Vault.  Your art, jewelry, handbags, carpets and other treasured items can be included in this category.
              
              <br><br> In short, W Vault is designed to simplify your life.

            <div class="accordion-body">W Vault allows you to manage information on your assets and liabilities on the go.  For example, if you have made a new investment you can immediately access your account, fill up the necessary details such as bank/institution name, account number, agent number and contact details and so on.  You can even upload the investment contract document.  If you reflect the value of your investment, it will enhance your dashboard.  You can then rest in peace that this information has been captured for your future reference.  Just delete or amend the information should you sell or change the investment at a later date.

              <br><br> We often store information on our assets and liabilities in different locations.  Some may be on an app on our phones, some may be on an excel sheet on a laptop, titles and receipts may be in our safety deposit box at home or in a bank.  W Vault allows you to store all this information in one place for ease of your reference.  If anything unexpected should happen to you, we undertake to pass this information to the person(s) you have identified, so they can have that information at hand (see explanation on notifier and access list).

              Now that you understand the What and the Why, below is a brief explanation of the process that you will be going through on W Vault. <br><br>We advise that you prepare your information such as account details in advance.  If you wish to store documents, have them on hand so you can easily upload them when prompted.  You can choose to do this in one sitting or visit your account as many times as you wish and fill it up bit by bit.  We understand this can be a tedious process.  We also know that it is a crucial, necessary, and responsible process to ensure your personal financial security and the financial security of your loved ones. <br><br>W Vault has provided for the following categories.  For each category, you are able to upload documents in PDF form and image file types such as JPN, PNG (to validate the info).  For example, in the category of property you may wish to upload the first page of the title, and the page with signatures.  Alternatively, you may wish to upload a word document where you have indicated where the titles are kept, information on the mortgage, any joint ownership, inheritance and wills related to the property; etc. <br><br> Assets Categories <br> <img src="https://wahine.s3.amazonaws.com/static/Img-Breadcrumb-Assets.png

              Note that the dashboard will only be meaningful is you input values.

                have the men on board. Because they are our partners, our fathers, our sons, our brothers
